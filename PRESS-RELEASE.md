There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Description ##
  > Public Registrar for GPS coordinates. The key is name-coordinate pair. User 'trademarks' the name  
    and can assign coordinates to it.

## Summary ##
  > Allows users to register GPS coordinates, by inputting the coordinate or an address, 
    with a unique identifier, and allow that unique identifier to be used as a reference.  
    This will also cut down on ambiguity on a location. Simple, sharable, location tags.  
    Also features a search bar to find the identifier's location on the map.

## Problem ##
  > Solves the problem of identifying a place uniquely, without offering up an official name for a  
    location, allowing users to create their own.  
    Cuts down on the time required to share meaningful location data.
  
## Solution ##
  > Our product will provide a user-friendly interface to register new identifier/coordinate pairs,  
    also featuring an easily accessible api.  
    Because the identifiers are simpler and more memorable than GPS co-ordinates, users will be  
    to share the locations more efficiently.

## Quote From Us ##
  > Our fantastic Product Owner, Steven Marks, says, "No longer will you suffer from using  
    long addresses and/or confusing coordinates!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Users will sign up for the service, and can then assign identifier-coordinate tags. The application  
    will automatically check the availability of the inputted identifier name.

## Customer Quote ##
  > User Cody Daig provides us with some very valuable insight from a user perspective. He says,  
    "I was in the process of tracking a tornado with my bros, and got lost in the storm! Luckily,  
    I was already signed up with [NAME], so my bros were able to guide me out of the darkness."
